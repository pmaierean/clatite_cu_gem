Why didn&#8217;t the Romanians get Slavicized?</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I believe that one can only ask the question about the language spoken in Romanian not about the people. The genetic origin of individuals that make up the Romanian population today, do not necessarily have exclusive or majority ancestry in such a population that lived a millennium ago. Most of us don&#8217;t know and cannot know all our ancestry past 200 - 300 years with accuracy. I would limit my answer to the evolution of the Romanian language (or rather is distribution)</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">In antiquity from the early 2nd to the late 3rd centuries the province of Dacia was a Roman Colony. Latin was brought into the land by settles who spoke that language natively at home. At the end of the Roman Principality (the extended crisis of the mid 3rd century) the Province was abandoned militarily and administratively for it made no sense to defend a Colony in the middle of Barbaricum having no secure land connection with the rest of the Empire</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Since the 4th century the Latin speaking population evolved and adapted to the topological constraints of Dacia, a mountainous arch surrounding forested valleys and hill. Those who survived the best were the Pastoral communities, that is communities that earned a living mostly from breading sheep. That was because, the topography allowed for bountiful pastures, salt and other minerals are common to find, and deep forests are natural defenses from raiders. But, the remoteness and isolation caused a sever backwardness and relative cultural poverty of the Romance speaking population in Dacia for the circumstances did not allowed for the preservation of writing, building skills etc (or at least we don&#8217;t know of that). Slavic people (Gepids and Avars too) did settle along the rivers in the vicinity of Romanians but given the easy access, any new inbound raining party (since 6 to 12th century there were a lot of them) affected them the most. The few survivors of attacks would join the Romanian Pastoral communities and only add to their demographics</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Chance opportunity came with the establishment of the Hungarian Kingdom in the former province of Pannonia. Roads became safe, new cities were built, and the economy prosper. The stabilization of the Hungarian lowlands meant the opening of new opportunities for trade, technological upgrades and a demographic expanse. The Romance speaking communities did integrate well into the new feudal state quite from it beginning (see <span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Romanians-manage-to-hide-from-the-eyes-of-chroniclers-for-almost-a-millennia-only-to-appear-in-Transylvania-in-the-13th-century/answer/Peter-Clings?ch=10&amp;share=08d9e881&amp;srid=3LJeg">Peter Clings's answer to How did the Romanians manage to hide from the eyes of chroniclers for almost a millennia, only to appear in Transylvania in the 13th century?</a></span> ) and benefited from its well being. But good times did not last though. In the struggles for feudal properties of the 13th century, some choose to leave (expand to the South and East). That is how the Romanian language spread across the Carpathians</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I my opinion the lowlands just west of the Black Sea, that were known as Moldova and Wallachia in the Middle Ages, had been the favorite passageways taken by a lot of nomadic raiders coming from the Eurasian steppe. The raiders were all attracted by the riches of the Mediterranean Civilizations, and the prospects for spoils. It was impossible to maintain a semblance of sedentary culture in those specific regions for a very long. No Slavic communities survived in the region at all</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It came as a window on opportunity in the late 13th century and early 14th when the Mongol Empire (rather the <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org" href="https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=972bb6&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Golden Horde)</a></span> experienced a period of weakness (civil wars) that allowed for an expansion of the Romance speaking population from Transsilvania, and the establishment of two feudal states, Wallachia and Moldova. The two Principalities were predominantly Romanian speaking from the get go, as that language had been used as a lingua franca in the Eastern side of the Hungarian Kingdom. With all later inbound of immigrants from Slavic speaking lands (Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia, and Poland) their languages of origin did influence the Romanian too but not as substantially as to change is affinity to the Latin</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">In a nutshell, the Romanian language did not became Slavic for its isolation and very special circumstances of the inner Carpathian Mountain Range</p></span></div><div><strong>Creation time: </strong><span>Nov 02, 2018 03:32 AM PDT</span></div><div><strong>Content language: </strong><span>English</span></div></p><hr /><p><h2>Answer</h2><div><strong>Question: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext">Did Christianity weaken the Roman Empire?</span></div><div><strong>Content: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext"><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Yes. The Roman military crede was centered on the cult of Mithras and later on Sol Invictus, sort of fraternities that mashed well with the idea of Pax Romana and based on prestige. These were replaced slowly after Constantine I with Christianity (centered on the salvation of the soul), with the effect of demoralizing the troups, the abandonment of old methods of maintaining popular cohesion (the Amphitheater and the Colosseum), and of the slavery. Short lived later attempts were made to revert the course of history (see Julian the Apostate)</p></span></div><div><strong>Creation time: </strong><span>Nov 02, 2018 01:04 PM PDT</span></div><div><strong>Content language: </strong><span>English</span></div></p><hr /><p><h2>Answer</h2><div><strong>Question: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext">In Jesus' time, what were the benefits of Roman citizenship?</span></div><div><strong>Content: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext"><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Paul, the Appstol who was a Roman Citizen, had benefitted from a &#8216;fairer&#8217; trial with the Roman Authorities as compared to Peter and other non-citizen Christians.

There is/was a continuous corridor that extends from the middle flow of river Tisza to the Western slopes of the Eastern Carpathian Mountains. This corridor follows a somewhat South-East direction if one try to trace it on a European map looking from the Pannonian Plain. This strip of maybe 100 km max width is a proof of the expansion and settlement of the early Magyars (here the Székelys are included) in Transylvania in the Middle Age. It includes the main salt mines of that region as those provided the essential commodity to justified the effort to expand with colonists. This corridor is more visible on the map next</p><div class="ui_qtext_image_outer"><div class="qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="landscape qtext_image zoomable_in_feed" master_h="980" master_src="images/qimg-78bdea20751233106c99a4bee45b49de" master_w="1231" src="images/qimg-78bdea20751233106c99a4bee45b49de"></div></div><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The central section of the corridor has lost it’s continuity for the strong industrialization of the city of Cluj (Kolozsvár) after WWII which attracted to the region a lot of people of non Magyar descent</p></span></div><div><strong>Creation time: </strong><span>Jun 14, 2019 01:33 PM PDT</span></div><div><strong>Content language: </strong><span>English</span></div><p></p></div></html>
